<p><font size="3">
  This is a clone of Billie Eilish Website built using <strong><em>HTML</em></strong> & <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>, It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Billie Eilish Website. it's a similar version of Billie Eilish Website with my own design touch, showing my abilities in HTML & CSS to build something advanced like Billie Eilish Website.
