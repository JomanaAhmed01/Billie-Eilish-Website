  Billie Eilish Website Clone Built Using HTML & CSS
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a clone of the singer Billie Eilish website built using <strong><em>HTML & CSS</em></strong>, It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Billie Eilish website. it's a similar version of Billie Eilish Website with my own design touch, showing my abilities in HTML & CSS to build something advanced like Billie Eilsh Website. It contains the home page, sign-up page & music page.
